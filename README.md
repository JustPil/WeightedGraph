# WeightedGraph
Summary

Graph ADT featuring edge weights and an adjacency matrix for internal storage of edges between any two vertices.

Design

Supports addition and removal of vertices or edges, discovery of edges or vertices, discovery of all adjacent vertices to any one vertex, and marking of vertices for traversal.

Allows for default vertex capacity or user-defined capacity with overloaded constructor. Internally, vertices are stored in a generic array, edges in a 2D array matrix, and traversed vertices in a boolean array.
